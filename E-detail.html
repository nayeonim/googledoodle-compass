		<div class="content">
			<div class="compass-img"><img src="images/detail/E.png"></div>
			<div class="description">The Modern baseplate compass uses the simple original method of fixing a magnetized needle inside a fluid-filled capsule. The fluid-filled method is still the standard method because of how the fluid dampens the movement of the needle so that it can stabilize quickly when oscillating around directions.
			<br><br>
			On top of the main function of the compass, many modern recreational and military compasses integrate different functions such as:
			<ul>
				<li>A protractor with a separate magnetized needle</li>
				<li>Map orienting lines at the bottom of the compass</li>
				<li>A transparent base underneath compass needle for measuring bearings, so that the tool can be used directly on a physical map</li>
				<li>Scales and sighting mechanisms (mirror, prism, etc.) for measuring distances and positions </li>
			</ul></div>
